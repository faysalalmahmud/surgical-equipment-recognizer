## üõ†Ô∏è Model Loading

### FastAI Model (.pkl)
```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

# Load the production model
learn = load_learner('models/surgical_equipment_recognizer_model_v2.pkl')

# Make predictions
pred, idx, probs = learn.predict('path/to/surgical_instrument.jpg')
print(f'Prediction: {pred} (Confidence: {probs[idx]:.2%})')
```

### PyTorch Weights (.pth)
```python
import torch
from fastai.vision.all import *

# Load model with custom weights (from Google Drive)
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)
learn.load('model_weights')  # .pth file from Google Drive
```


## üöÄ Deployment

The production model (`v2.pkl`) is deployed on:
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: [Live Application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/faysalalmahmud/surgical-equipment-recognizer)
